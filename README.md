## **About WeHear** 🎙️
WeHear is an application specialized for individuals with difficulty hearing that provides timely alerts through notifications and visual flashes in response to specific sounds.

## **Our Mission** 🎯
We are addressing challenges faced by individuals with hearing difficulties, such as failing to hear crucial alarms like fire alarms, smoke detectors, or mothers missing their babies' cries (and a whole BUNCH of other sounds! - _more than 500 sounds_, in fact).

## **Key Features** 💡
- **Smart Sound Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning for accurate sound recognition.
- **Customizable alerts:** Customize the app to your own unique needs with personalized alert settings
- **Real-time Notifications:** Receive instant alerts.
- **Visual Alerts:** Provides attention-catching alerts through a flashing screen.
- **Extensive Sound Database:** Access to a huge library of various sounds.

**Developer notes:** My "mobile app" is actually a website, and I initially did try to create a mobile app but realized there's not enough time to learn a whole new language, so I only had to rely on my web development skills that I already had. Thus, I decided to create a mobile web app. I plan to re-create this as a mobile app once I master React Native.
